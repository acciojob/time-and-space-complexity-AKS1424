	 <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the measure of how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the amount of time it takes to execute. It helps us understand how the algorithm's performance scales as the input size increases. An efficient algorithm is one that minimizes the time required for execution.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity, denoted as <b>Space Complexity</b>, assesses the amount of memory or space an algorithm uses with respect to the input size. It is typically expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), to indicate how the space requirements grow linearly with the size of the input.</p>
